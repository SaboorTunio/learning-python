# What is Loop ?
- **Defination:** A loop is control flow structure that repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Why use loops ?**
 - Automate repetitive times.
 - Process data multiple times.
 - Reduce redundancy in code.

## There are two main types of loops in Python:
1. **For loop**
   - The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or any other iterable object.
     -  *Example:**
```
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```
2. **While loop**
   - The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true. 
     -  *Example:**
```
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

```
