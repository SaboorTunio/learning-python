# For Loop Syntax and Example
# Syntax: 
# for variable in sequence:
   # Code to execute for each item in sequence

# Example :
# for letter in 'Python':
#     print(letter)# First Example
      
# How for Loops Work
# Visualize the Iteration :**
# The for loop picks the first item from the sequence, assigns it to the loop variable, runs the code, then moves to the next item in the sequence.

# Example with a List :

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# The range () Function
# What is range()? A function used to generate a sequence of number, commonly used in for loops.
# range (start,stop,step)
# start : The starting number (default is 0).  
# stop :  The number at which the sequqnce stops (exclusive).
# step : The increment between numbers (default is 1).  
# for number in range(1, 5):
#     print(number)

# Looping Over Strings
# Explanation : Strings are sequences, so you can use a for loop to iterate over each character in a string.

# Example :
# for letter in 'Python':
#     print(letter)


# Looping Over Lists
#Example :
# cities = ['New York', 'Paris', 'London']
# for city in cities:
#     print(city)
