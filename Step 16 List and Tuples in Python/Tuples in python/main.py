# Introduction to Tuples
# Defination : A tuple is a collection of items likes a list, but tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
# Example :

# dimensions = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# print(dimensions)

# Accessing Elements in a Tuple
# Tuples use the same indexing as lists.
# Example :

# dimensions = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# print(dimensions[0]) # Output : 1
# print(dimensions[-2]) # Output : 4

# Looping Through a Tuple 
# you can use for loops to iterate through tuples just like with lists
# Example :

# dimensions = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# for dimension in dimensions:
#     print(dimension)
