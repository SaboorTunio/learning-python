# Strings Concatenation with + operator :

## String Concatenation using +
```
name = "Saboor Tunio"
age = 17
print("My name is " + name + "and I am " + str(age) + " year old" )
```
## Limitation: Using + can messy for complex outputs.

# Using f-strings (recommended) : 

## Formatted String (f-strings):

```print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} year old")```

## Advantages Cleaner and easier to read than Concatenation
